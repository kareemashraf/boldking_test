## Laravel Framework 5.8.11

The reason to use Laravel framework is to be as close as possible to the current work environment in BoldKing


## How to set it up

- first Clone the Project
- access the project's directory on terminal
- run the following code :
## php artisan migrate
- run the "boldking_sample_test.sql" SQL file from the root directory to add values in the migrated DB
- run the following code :
## php artisan serve
- now you can access the project on localhost with port 8000
- PS : Keep in mind that as per the requirement No Frontend implemented 
- app/Http/Controller/Controller.php (the path where it has most of the project) also please check Routes/web.php
